ArcGIS Pro parcel fabric samples and snippets using various ArcGIS SDKs and APIs

## ArcGIS Javascript API [parcels-jsapi](https://github.com/kgalliher/arcgis-projects/tree/main/parcels-jsapi)
### Samples that demonstrate using TypeScript and ESM modules with a published parcel fabric. Includes calls to `ParcelFabricServer`, `FeatureServer` and `VersionManagementServer` endpoints

### [Digitize/Build Parcels](https://github.com/kgalliher/arcgis-projects/tree/main/parcels-jsapi/Parcels-Digitize-Build)
Draw lines and polygons and build them into the Pro Parcel Fabric

### [Parcel Split/Build Workflow](https://github.com/kgalliher/arcgis-projects/tree/main/parcels-jsapi/Parcels-Split-Merge-Seeds-Build)
FabricESM is a TypeScript application that provides a user interface to select parcels in a parcel fabric, run the Merge function from the parcelfabricserver REST endpoint, and update specific attributes of the new parcel.

## [Using Python API for Branch Version Conflicts](https://github.com/kgalliher/arcgis-projects/tree/main/parcels-rest-conflicts)
Use the ArcGIS Python API as a REST client to detect branch versioning conflicts and find verrsion differences in a parcel fabric
